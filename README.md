### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Choose between 4 simple operations and exit the Shopping list.

## My process

As my second python project I faced many challenges to get to the solution, since I had to use some properties I never used before. A couple years ago I had some experience with C/C++ and that was all the experience I had on backend tech.

With that, I had the need to do some researh on new properties of the language and also ask for some help of a friend. 

I'm pretty sure my previvous experience helped me get through this, due to some simmilarity on the sintax. But it was very challenging to learn new properties and apply then to the project on such a short amount of time. 

Also had to use a uuid package to generate random IDs for each product in the shopping list, packages were something I've never used before.

Working with Python has shown me new aspects of programming.


### Built with

- Python

### What I learned

Python sintax.
Indentaion.
Different IDE (PyCharm)
Try
Except
Del
Import
Uuid

### Continued development

I'll make a couple projects in python to get used to it, to have a little expertise on a backend tech stack.
